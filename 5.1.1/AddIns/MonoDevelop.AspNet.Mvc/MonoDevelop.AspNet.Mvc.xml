            Parser used by editors to avoid reparsing the entire document on each text change
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This parser is designed to allow editors to avoid having to worry about incremental parsing.
            The CheckForStructureChanges method can be called with every change made by a user in an editor and
            the parser will provide a result indicating if it was able to incrementally reparse the document.
            The general workflow for editors with this parser is:
            0. User edits document
            1. Editor builds TextChange structure describing the edit and providing a reference to the _updated_ text buffer
            2. Editor calls CheckForStructureChanges passing in that change.
            3. Parser determines if the change can be simply applied to an existing parse tree node
            a.  If it can, the Parser updates its parse tree and returns PartialParseResult.Accepted
            b.  If it can not, the Parser starts a background parse task and return PartialParseResult.Rejected
            NOTE: Additional flags can be applied to the PartialParseResult, see that enum for more details.  However,
            the Accepted or Rejected flags will ALWAYS be present
            A change can only be incrementally parsed if a single, unique, Span (see System.Web.Razor.Parser.SyntaxTree) in the syntax tree can
            be identified as owning the entire change.  For example, if a change overlaps with multiple spans, the change cannot be
            parsed incrementally and a full reparse is necessary.  A Span "owns" a change if the change occurs either a) entirely
            within it's boundaries or b) it is a pure insertion (see TextChange) at the end of a Span whose CanGrow flag (see Span) is
            true.
            Even if a single unique Span owner can be identified, it's possible the edit will cause the Span to split or merge with other
            Spans, in which case, a full reparse is necessary to identify the extent of the changes to the tree.
            When the RazorEditorParser returns Accepted, it updates CurrentParseTree immediately.  However, the editor is expected to
            update it's own data structures independently.  It can use CurrentParseTree to do this, as soon as the editor returns from
            CheckForStructureChanges, but it should (ideally) have logic for doing so without needing the new tree.
            When Rejected is returned by CheckForStructureChanges, a background parse task has _already_ been started.  When that task
            finishes, the DocumentStructureChanged event will be fired containing the new generated code, parse tree and a reference to
            the original TextChange that caused the reparse, to allow the editor to resolve the new tree against any changes made since
            calling CheckForStructureChanges.
            If a call to CheckForStructureChanges occurs while a reparse is already in-progress, the reparse is cancelled IMMEDIATELY
            and Rejected is returned without attempting to reparse.  This means that if a conusmer calls CheckForStructureChanges, which
            returns Rejected, then calls it again before DocumentParseComplete is fired, it will only recieve one DocumentParseComplete
            event, for the second change.
